# Uber-Search-Time-Series-Forecasting

In this repo, I have developed multiple approaches for forecasting the number of times that the word "Uber" has been seraced in google,
over past five years. The data is obtained from google trends. I have written several functions to facilitate the exploration of the data
and evaluation of the residuals. The R script containing these functions are provided. In what follows, different approaches are provided and their results are presented and discussed.
